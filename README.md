# camelCase-project

### Project Description

Location-based file sharing is what we are planning on doing for our project. We created our own database server on our personal laptops and used a geo-location finder using Google Maps API. The reason we chose to use Flask and JavaScript is that we will be able to integrate our code easily on the web on any platform. 

Our web app targets professionals and students who will be required to give the app access to their location in order for the application to function properly. The application will be able to support a variety of different file types, including images, videos, etc. The web server will be built using Flask with MongoDB as they are useful for getting the files to the users and sending them back to the correct location.

By allowing users to not only publish images and text but PDFs and other files to our applicationâ€™s server, we created both a new form of social media sharing as well as a useful tool for our users. By founding the sharing of files in a location-based methodology we eliminate the need for users to share links to particular websites or navigate through overly complex web-based storage systems and rather allow them to retrieve files simply and easily.  

### Organization and Structure
##### Templates
Where the HTML files with neccicary JavaScript are kept to be populated by the Flask server. 
##### Static
Where images and CSS files are kept. This is for pathing for Flask. This is also where uploads go for server-side linking. 
##### server.py
The server code that dictates what gets rendered where, and calls functions that query the Mongo database.
##### mongoIO.py
Contains the diffrent DB query functions, as well as other Mongo DB handlers.

## Overview for Setup
### Build Codebase
##### Libraries
Requires Flask
Requires PyMongo
##### Database
Requires MongoDB

### To Run
Run server.py and connect to localhost:5000

### To Test
Run the mongoIO.py file. 


## In-depth Setup
We are using flask and mongo.
### Flask Install
We're using PyCharm but you are free to use any other IDE.

##### PyCharm
To set up the interpreter you will need to go to `File > Settings...` and then go to `Project: camelCase-project > Project Interpreter` or `Project: flask-server > Project Interpreter` depending on what folder you opened. From here go to the setting button and add a new environment (we are using python 3).

You will need to install Flask and pymongo. In the `Project Interpreter` part click the add button and search for these and click install.

Now run `server.py` and you should see flask starting up. Just go to:
```
http://localhost:5000/
```

##### Linux
For Linux, you can create a virtualEnv or add all libraries globally by doing the following.
First, you will need to run.
```
pip3 install flask
pip3 install pymongo
```
And then run the following in the `flask-server` directory to run the program.
```
python3 server.py
```

Now when you run you should see flask starting up. Just go to:
```
http://localhost:5000/
```

### Mongo
Install mongo here: [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

Make sure you also install the python driver. It is called `pymongo`. You can get it the same way you got flask.
